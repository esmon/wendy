I designed and executed a month long social media calendar and an event poster leading to the retreat date.</p><p>Using photography from <a href=\"http://www.matthewmanhire.com/\">Matthew Manhire</a>, I designed the campaign around the significance of the triangle, which in yoga practice represents feminity and empowerment. A triangle facing downwards represents womanhood and strength, which is central to the two womenâ€™s practice.</p><p>My role: Art Direction and design.</p>",
