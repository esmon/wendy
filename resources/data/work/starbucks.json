Those spots along the lines where cell service becomes available if only for a brief moment, a persistent-image sequence of posters inside the tunnels will ask our customers to prepare their app to place an order. When the train reaches an area with cell service or T-Connect Wifi, another poster will tell them to “Order Now!” The point is that when they do order, their beverage will be ready when they arrive to the nearest Starbucks location upon exiting.</p>"

Using a simple plastic prism, we can create a hologram video that will play on the customer’s phone. This hologram will replace the current video on the app’s Mobile Order &amp; Pay screen that explains how the process works. Instead of seeing a step-by-step video of MOP, customers will now be walked through the process by the pocket barista.</p> "
